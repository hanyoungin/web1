  <p>Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">Biology is the science of life. Its name is derived from the Greek words "bios" (life) and "logos" (study). Biologists study the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution and distribution of living organisms. There are generally considered to be at least nine "umbrella" fields of biology, each of which consists of multiple subfields.

  <p>Biochemistry: the study of the material substances that make up living things</p>
  <p>Botany: the study of plants, including agriculture</p>
  <p>Cellular biology: the study of the basic cellular units of living things</p>
  <p>Ecology: the study of how organisms interact with their environment</p>
  <p>Evolutionary biology: the study of the origins and changes in the diversity of life over time</p>
  <p>Genetics: the study of heredity</p>
  <p>Molecular biology: the study of biological molecules</p>
  <p>Physiology: the study of the functions of organisms and their parts</p>
  <p>Zoology: the study of animals, including animal behavior</p>
